# NFL Mangement System

These Python scripts simulate an NFL team and schedule management system.

## Description

All information through this program is displayed and entered into the console.

### Teams

Teams store a roster (of NFL players) that can be manipulated to add or remove certain players from each team's roster. Players that are removed are not saved in any meaningful/useful way.
Teams store fundamental information about themselves such as their city, stadium, head coach, and an image/logo.
Teams store a schedule that game objects can be added to in a queue-like fashion; a list of played games is stored in a stack-like fashion.

### Games

Games store fundamental information about themselves: both teams' scores.
Games can be associated with 2 teams (home and away). 
Games can be "played" by either team and require both teams' scores to be inputted. The games then enter the played games list.
